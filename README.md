# Hello!

This is a simple repository with example code and baselines to train and evaluate models on AddBiomechanics data, using the `nimble.biomechanics.SubjectOnDisk` class to handle efficient binary storage formats.

To get started, first:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then to run a few epochs of training:

`python3 main.py`
